## Half-Life Crosshair Changer ##

Half-Life 1 has a static Crosshair in the form of crosshairs.spr.
It isn't the best Crosshair for orange coloured maps, nor is it that great for accuracy. You can't really change the Crosshair without messing around with the .spr file and if you messed up you would just have a black square on your screen.

### Until Now ###

I have edited several .spr files to bring you a collection of colorful and accurate Crosshairs for Half-Life.

They Include:

- **9** Different Crosshairs including the default
- **7** Different colours for each Crosshair
- **1** consistent Crosshair for all of your weapons

## Installation Instructions ##

Extract @Crosshair Changer.bat and crosshairs to the root directory of your Half-Life directory.

### Usage ###

Run @Crosshair Changer.bat and input the number relevant to your choice. Open up Half-Life and you will now have your new crosshair.

You can always return to the default crosshair by running @Crosshair Changer again and selecting "Original".
