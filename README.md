## Half-Life Crosshair Changer ##

*Half-Life* has a static crosshair in the form of a file called `crosshairs.spr`.
It isn't the best crosshair for orange coloured maps, and it isn't that great for accuracy.

You can't really change the crosshair without messing around with the crosshair in the console like the newer source games, you have to edit the `crosshairs.spr` file and if you make a mistake you have a black square on your screen.

### Until Now! ###

I have created several `.spr` files to bring you a **collection of colorful and accurate crosshairs** for *Half-Life.*

**They Include:**

- ***9*** Different Crosshairs including the default
- ***7*** Different colours for each Crosshair
- ***1*** consistent Crosshair for all of your weapons

### Installation Instructions ###

----------

Extract `@Crosshair Changer.bat` and the `crosshairs` folder to the root directory of your Half-Life directory.

### Usage ###

Run `@Crosshair Changer.bat` and input the number relevant to your choice. Open up Half-Life and you will now have your new crosshair.

You can always return to the default crosshair by running `@Crosshair` Changer again and selecting "Original".
